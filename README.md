# android-app-development

All three exercises all in the same project. It was easier putting them in the same project and uploading it here.

All of them seem to work when running separately but there was some 
problems with the Android studio after updating it to 2.2.

If the assignments were any bigger it would have been wiser to put them on different projects.
Now they are just different activities bundeled in a single project
